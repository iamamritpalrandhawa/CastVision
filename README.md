# CastVision: Automated Metal Casting Defect Detection

Metal casting is a widely used manufacturing process in which molten metal is poured into a mold and allowed to solidify. However, defects introduced during this process can reduce product quality and lead to significant production losses.

CastVision is a deep learning–based image classification system developed to automate the quality inspection of metal casting products. The model analyzes casting images and classifies them as defective or non-defective, reducing dependency on manual inspection.

## Objective
- Automates defect detection
- Improves inspection accuracy
- Reduces time and human error in quality control

## Dataset used for this project:
[Casting products image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product)

## Type of data:
The problem is an image classification problem. We have a train dataset having 6633 images and test dataset of 715 images

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in industrial quality control. Automated inspection systems like CastVision can significantly improve efficiency and consistency in manufacturing environments and can be adapted to similar industrial inspection tasks with minimal modifications.
